== Submitting patches

Please take care to do the following:

* Clean up your patch (don't send a patch bomb with a hundred features in one)
* Write test cases!
* As a general rule of thumb, think of ways to make things more general purpose than specific. 

Now the no need to make in your Gemfile the following gem 'calendar_date_select', :git => 'git://github.com/paneq/calendar_date_select.git'
 as it is now found as a gem on rubyGems.org 
what u need to do just add the following in your Gemfile :
   gem 'calendar_date_select_rails3', :require=>'calendar_date_select'
